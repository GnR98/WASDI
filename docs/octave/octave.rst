# WASDI

This is WASPY, the WASDI Python lib.

WASDI is an ESA GSTP Project sponsored by ASI in 2016. The system is a fully scalable and distributed Cloud based EO analytical platform. The system is cross-cloud and cross DIAS.
WASDI is an operating platform that offers services to develop and deploy DIAS based EO on-line applications, designed
to extract value-added information, made and distributed by EO-Experts without any specific IT/Cloud skills.
WASDI offers as well to End-Users the opportunity to run EO applications both from a dedicated user-friendly interface
and from an API based software interface, fulfilling the real-world business needs.
EO-Developers can work using the WASDI Libraries in their usual programming languages and add to the platform these new blocks
in the simplest possible way.

Note:
the philosophy of safe programming is adopted as widely as possible, the lib will try to workaround issues such as
faulty input, and print an error rather than raise an exception, so that your program can possibly go on. Please check
the return statues
