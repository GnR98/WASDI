Wasdi App Store
==================

In this tutorial the WASDI app store will be introduced.
We will higlight the main feature of this WASDI sections and also,
 we will see how a WASDI application can be launched.

The app store concept is pretty common for mobile devices and our efforts
was invested to develop the same user experience for the WASDI web service.
An user can upload, execute and share his own application directly on
a web browser, with a fast and consistent user experience.
Also, a dedicated graphical interface(UI) can be added to the application,
allowing to supply other users a well taylore experience. :-)
