WASDI : Web Advanced Space Developer Interface
==================================================

WASDI implements a unique, simple and intuitive interface to foster the exploitation of the asset concerning EO data and satellite products, for satisfying requirements of usersâ€™ communities and, in particular, experts/researchers in the field of Earth Sciences, managers of services and public administrations (i.e. civil protection decision makers). 

WASDI allows researchers to gather satellite data, in particular the Sentinel ones, display them on-line, run algorithms, displaying and evaluating the results, and allows to share these projects among different users.

The results of the calculations will then be available for download, allowing local further processing, or published directly through the Web.

Getting Started with WASDI
---------------------------
WASDI web platform is the best starting point for your journey on Earth Observations (EO) resources !

This :doc:`basic tutorial </WasdiTutoria>`  will help to acquire the main concepts and use WASDI for your EO research.
